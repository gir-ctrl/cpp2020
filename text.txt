Travelling is very popular nowadays. A lot of people travel to different countries 
if they have such opportunity. Travelling allows you to get interesting 
experience, learn about people’s life in other countries and continents. 
I think it is very interesting to discover new things,
 new places and different ways of life. While on travel, you meet new people, try different meals; see world famous places with your own eyes.
There are many ways of traveling – by train, by plane, by ship, on foot.
 If you want to visit a far country, you’ll definitely 
choose a flight. If your aim is to see many countries for a short time, you’ll choose travelling by bus or by car. If you want to be closer to nature, you may choose a trip on foot.
Lots of people nowadays live in big cities. So it’s natural that they
 want to have a holiday by the sea or in 
mountains with nothing to do but relaxing. There is other sort of travellers. They want to visit as many countries as possible. So after exploring Europe and North America they go to exotic countries.
People who travel a lot, are very interesting, they always have a good
 story to tell. Thanks to them you can learn many things which you didn’t know before. They motivate to see something new, to explore the world, which is so easy to do nowadays. Any kind of travelling helps you to understand many things that you would never see or learn at home.
